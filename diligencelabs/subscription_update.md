Current Issues ObservedWhen clicking on a subscription card, it redirects to the login page instead of a dedicated process.
The "Book Consultation" page is missing.
There is no option for a timed consultation service.

Proposed Design ChangesSubscription-Specific Forms: Design custom forms for each subscription plan (Basic, Professional, Enterprise) that align with the overall website ethos, including payment forms.
User Flow for Subscriptions:User clicks on a subscription plan.
If not logged in, prompt to create an account.
After account creation/login, direct to the subscription-specific application form.

Alternative Layout Suggestion: Create a dedicated "Services" page to list all pricing and service plans. This keeps the home page clean and optimized for user experience.
