# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

**Project:** Decentralized Due Diligence Marketplace  
**Version:** 0.1.2  
**Date:** Sept 17, 2025  
**Prepared by:** [Team/Author Name]

---

## 1. Overview
The goal is to build a decentralized due diligence marketplace where users (founders, VCs, ecosystem partners) can submit projects for community-driven due diligence and evaluation. Verified experts collaboratively assess projects across key dimensions (team, product-market fit, infrastructure, current status, etc.) and assign scoring, comments, and recommendations.

The platform ensures transparency, credibility, and community alignment by introducing identity verification for experts, project validation processes, DeFi incentives, and gamified participation.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Provide a **trustworthy, decentralized platform** for project due diligence.
- Enable **VCs and founders** to submit projects for evaluation by verified experts.
- Build a **verification and validation system** for both experts and projects.
- Create a **collaborative evaluation process** with scoring and commentary across dimensions.
- Introduce **DeFi mechanisms** (staking, rewards, governance tokens) to incentivize fair participation.
- Add **gamification** (leaderboards, badges, tiers) to drive community engagement and reputation building.

---

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Project Submission
- Users/VCs connect their **X (Twitter) account** for identity verification.
- Submission form includes:
  - Project name, description, and website
  - Founding team details
  - Current status and traction
  - Technical infrastructure
  - Funding raised (if applicable)

### 3.2 Expert Assignment & Evaluation
- Experts are **randomly assigned** or **opt-in** based on expertise.
- Experts collaborate on due diligence using a structured evaluation form:
  - **Team**
  - **Product-Market Fit (PMF)**
  - **Current Status & Roadmap**
  - **Infrastructure & Technology**
  - **Competitive Landscape**
  - **Risks & Concerns**
- Each category receives **scoring + commentary**.

### 3.3 Verification & Validation System
- **Expert verification:**
  - KYC (minimal disclosure)
  - Proof of credentials (work history, GitHub, LinkedIn)
  - Peer-review validation (community vote)
- **Project validation:**
  - Cross-check project’s website/domain
  - Founder social proof (X, LinkedIn)
  - Smart contract audit verification (if DeFi-related)

### 3.4 DeFi Mechanisms
- **Staking for participation:**
  - Experts stake tokens to participate; ensures accountability.
- **Reward distribution:**
  - Token rewards distributed based on contribution quality and accuracy.
- **Slashing conditions:**
  - Bad faith or inaccurate assessments lead to stake penalties.
- **Governance token:**
  - DAO-like governance for roadmap, project acceptance, and dispute resolution.

### 3.5 Gamification Layer
- **Reputation scores** for experts based on accuracy, community feedback, and participation.
- **Leaderboards** by expertise and category.
- **Achievement badges** for milestones (e.g., 10 successful evaluations, top 5% scorer).
- **Tier system** (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum experts).

### 3.6 User Dashboard
- Project submitter view: project status, assigned experts, due diligence report.
- Expert view: assigned projects, stake overview, rewards earned.
- Public view: aggregated due diligence reports (with optional paywall for detailed access).

---

## 4. User Roles
- **Project Submitter (Founder/VC)**: submits projects for evaluation.
- **Expert**: verified professionals who perform due diligence.
- **Community Members**: can view results, vote, and provide feedback.
- **DAO/Governance participants**: shape marketplace rules.

---

## 5. Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: React / Next.js (mobile-first)
- **Backend**: Node.js, decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave), GraphQL API
- **Blockchain Layer**: Ethereum / L2 (Polygon, Arbitrum) for staking, rewards, and governance.
- **Identity Verification**: OAuth for X (Twitter), optional decentralized identity (ENS, DID)
- **Smart Contracts**:
  - Staking & rewards
  - Governance voting
  - Expert validation
- **Database**: Decentralized (Ceramic, OrbitDB) or hybrid with PostgreSQL

---

## 6. Success Metrics
- Number of projects submitted & evaluated per month
- Number of verified experts onboarded
- Community engagement (votes, comments, governance proposals)
- Accuracy/quality of evaluations (measured by follow-up project performance)
- Token staking volume & distribution
- User retention & leaderboard participation

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigation
- **Sybil attacks:** Require staking, KYC, and peer validation.
- **Low expert participation:** Incentivize with rewards, leaderboards, and tiered reputation.
- **Project misrepresentation:** Implement project validation system and fact-checking layers.
- **Token volatility:** Consider stablecoin rewards alongside governance tokens.

---

## 8. Roadmap (v0.1.2 → future iterations)
- **v0.1.2 (current):** Define PRD, identity verification design, staking contract outline.
- **v0.1.3:** Build MVP (submission + expert assignment + scoring system).
- **v0.1.4:** Integrate staking & rewards, basic DAO governance.
- **v0.2.0:** Launch gamification features (leaderboards, badges).
- **v0.3.0:** Full-scale rollout with project paywall reports and advanced validation.

---

## 9. Open Questions
- Should evaluations be fully public or gated behind token staking/paywall?
- How to prevent expert bias when reviewing competitor projects?
- Should rewards be based on project success post-evaluation (long-term) or immediate scoring consensus?
